Description: Performs iterative extrapolation of species' haplotype accumulation curves using a nonparametric stochastic (Monte Carlo) optimization method for assessment of specimen sampling completeness based on the approach of Phillips et al. (2015) <doi:10.1515/dna-2015-0008>, Phillips et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/ece3.4757> and Phillips et al. (2020) <doi: 10.7717/peerj-cs.243>. HACSim outputs a number of useful summary statistics of sampling coverage ("Measures of Sampling Closeness"), including an estimate of the likely required sample size (along with desired level confidence intervals) necessary to recover a given number/proportion of observed unique species' haplotypes. Any genomic marker can be targeted to assess likely required specimen sample sizes for genetic diversity assessment. The method is particularly well-suited to assess sampling sufficiency for DNA barcoding initiatives. Users can also simulate their own DNA sequences according to various models of nucleotide substitution.
